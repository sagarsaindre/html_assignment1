        <p class="text-center">Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT) is the first private Engineering Institute to be established in the city of Pune, Maharashtra. It is one of the premier institutes for Indian and international students offering Undergraduate and Postgraduate courses in Engineering, Management, Medicine, Pharmacy, Design, and so on.
      Contributing towards the industrial, economic, and social growth of the society for over a quarter of a century, Maharashtra Academy of Engineering Education and Research (MAEER)â€™s MIT Group of Institutions has helped realize the dreams and aspirations of thousands of students. The group has spread its wings across Maharashtra with campuses in Kothrud, Alandi, and Loni- Kalbhor within Pune, along with Latur, Talegaon, Ambejogai, and Pandharpur.

      Being the brainchild of its visionary founder, Prof. Vishwanath D. Karad, MAEER established in 1983, managed to craft a niche position for being a one-of-its-kind undertaking that focused on value-based education.</p>
